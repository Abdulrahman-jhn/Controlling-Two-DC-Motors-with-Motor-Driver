# Controlling-Two-DC-Motors-with-Motor-Driver


# Summary

-in this repository there is a project which two motors are controlled via a motor driver called L293D

-the driver was programmed to move each motor opposite to the other one

-the controlling of the driver can be changed duo to the user preference 

-the datasheet of this driver show each pin is used for what, to use it you must first enable the pins you want to use the put high/low on the pins to mive forward,
if it was low/high it will run backward

-if both are high or low the motor will not run

- the signal pins from the out put to the arduino is the pins that you want to but high or low on it

-circuit diagrams are included for the project


# How to Run

-you can download the .ino file and copy the diagram on Tinkercad.com and run it

-you can upload the .ino file straight in your arduino uno and run it
